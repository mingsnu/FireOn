A little java game under developing.

This project is used as a practice when I learning the java language.

You are welcome to give me more suggestions about the project.

## Game Rule
Two players, each draws three planes in a 10 x 10 grid tableï¼Œthen takes turns firing on each other, the one who first hits all three plane heads wins.
